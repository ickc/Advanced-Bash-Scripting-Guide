# Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide

This is a fork of version 10 of this guide, from the SGML source by Mendel Cooper. The original author has said in an email that project is no longer maintained.

Currently this repository process the SGML source by pandoc to enhance the documents in its output. The only thing done so far (besides having a different converter) is to add syntax highlight using a pandoc filter `codeblock_add_sh_class.py`.

Example output formats are provided in the releases.

There's no plan to change the content (i.e. version of the document should freeze at version 10) besides bring it up to better output presentations.
